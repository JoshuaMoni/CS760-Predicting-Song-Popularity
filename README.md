# CS760: Prediciting Song Popularity

### Overview 
- Main idea is to predict if a song will be popular from metadata features. 
- Original features are collected from Spotify using spotipy

## Requirements
- See `requirements.txt`
- Best to use conda envs `conda create -n predict_song`


### Datasets 
Due to the size of the datasets they are being stored in a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1aF8HNbsQqvZaUgvxPLQzAkRhkkQhVzNr).
Place them in a Data folder outside the working Git directory to avoid large file warings.
